# Replyke Connection System - Design & Implementation Plan

## Overview

This document outlines the design and implementation plan for adding bidirectional "Connection" relationships to the Replyke social features framework. Connections complement the existing one-way "Follow" system by providing mutual friend/connection functionality similar to Facebook friends or LinkedIn connections.

## Current State Analysis

### Existing Follow System
- **Model**: `Follow` (`src/models/Follow.ts`)
- **Type**: One-way relationships
- **Fields**: `id`, `projectId`, `followerId`, `followedId`, `createdAt`
- **Associations**:
  - User hasMany Follow as "following" (followerId)
  - User hasMany Follow as "followers" (followedId)

### Limitations
- No mutual relationship requirement
- No request/approval workflow
- No way to establish bidirectional "friend" relationships
- Limited social graph functionality

## Connection System Design

### Core Concept
Connections are **bidirectional relationships** that require **mutual agreement** between two users. Unlike follows, connections represent equal partnerships similar to friendships or professional connections.

### Key Design Principles

1. **Single Model Approach**: Use one `Connection` model to handle both requests and established connections
2. **Complete History**: Maintain full interaction history (requests, responses, status changes)
3. **Duplicate Prevention**: Prevent multiple active requests between same users
4. **Industry Standards**: Follow patterns from Facebook, LinkedIn, and other major platforms

## Database Schema

### Connection Model

```typescript
// src/models/Connection.ts
interface IConnectionAttributes {
  id: string;
  projectId: string;
  requesterId: string;    // User who initiated the connection request
  receiverId: string;     // User who received the connection request
  status: 'pending' | 'accepted' | 'declined';
  message?: string;       // Optional message with connection request
  respondedAt?: Date;     // When the request was responded to (accept/decline)
  createdAt: Date;        // When the request was sent
}
```

### Status Definitions

| Status | Description | Initiator | Receiver | Notes |
|--------|-------------|-----------|----------|-------|
| `pending` | Request sent, awaiting response | Can withdraw | Can accept/decline | Active request state |
| `accepted` | Connection established | Equal partners | Equal partners | Bidirectional relationship |
| `declined` | Request rejected | Cannot re-request | Can delete & create new request | After decline, only receiver can re-initiate |

### Database Constraints

```sql
-- Unique constraint to prevent duplicate requests
UNIQUE INDEX idx_connection_unique ON Connections (projectId, requesterId, receiverId);

-- Optimized indexes for common queries
INDEX idx_connection_requester ON Connections (projectId, requesterId, status);
INDEX idx_connection_receiver ON Connections (projectId, receiverId, status);
INDEX idx_connection_status ON Connections (projectId, status);
INDEX idx_connection_created ON Connections (projectId, createdAt);
```

### User Model Associations

```typescript
// In User.associate()
User.hasMany(Connection, {
  foreignKey: "requesterId",
  as: "sentConnections",
  onDelete: "CASCADE"
});

User.hasMany(Connection, {
  foreignKey: "receiverId",
  as: "receivedConnections",
  onDelete: "CASCADE"
});
```

## API Design

### Router Structure
```
src/v5/routers/users.ts      // User-centric connection operations
src/v5/routers/connections.ts  // Connection list operations
```

### Endpoints

| Method | Endpoint | Controller | Description |
|--------|----------|------------|-------------|
| **User-centric operations (under `/users` router)** |
| POST | `/users/:userId/connection` | `requestConnection` | Send connection request to user |
| GET | `/users/:userId/connection` | `fetchConnectionStatus` | Get connection status with user |
| DELETE | `/users/:userId/connection` | `removeConnectionByUserId` | Decline/withdraw/disconnect with user |
| GET | `/users/:userId/connections` | `fetchConnectionsByUserId` | Get connections of specific user |
| GET | `/users/:userId/connections-count` | `fetchConnectionsCountByUserId` | Get connections count for specific user |
| **Connection-centric operations (under `/connections` router)** |
| GET | `/connections` | `fetchConnections` | List established connections |
| GET | `/connections/count` | `fetchConnectionsCount` | Get connections count |
| GET | `/connections/pending/sent` | `fetchSentPendingConnections` | List sent pending requests |
| GET | `/connections/pending/received` | `fetchReceivedPendingConnections` | List received pending requests |
| PUT | `/connections/:connectionId/accept` | `acceptConnection` | Accept specific connection |
| PUT | `/connections/:connectionId/decline` | `declineConnection` | Decline specific connection |
| DELETE | `/connections/:connectionId` | `removeConnection` | Remove specific connection |

## API Documentation

### Base URLs
Connection endpoints are split across two routers under the `/v5/` namespace:
```
User-centric operations: https://your-api-domain.com/v5/users
List operations: https://your-api-domain.com/v5/connections
```

### Authentication
All endpoints require user authentication via the `requireUserAuth` middleware. Include the user's JWT token in the Authorization header:
```
Authorization: Bearer <jwt_token>
```

### Rate Limiting
- Connection requests: 25 requests per 5 minutes
- Other endpoints: 50-100 requests per 5 minutes

### Content Type
All requests should include:
```
Content-Type: application/json
```

### Controller Architecture

Following the project's resource-centric pattern with clear separation:

```
src/v5/controllers/
├── users/connections/                  # User-centric connection operations
│   ├── requestConnection.ts            # Send connection request to user
│   ├── fetchConnectionStatus.ts        # Check connection status with user
│   ├── removeConnectionByUserId.ts     # Decline/withdraw/disconnect with user
│   ├── fetchConnectionsByUserId.ts     # Get connections of specific user
│   └── fetchConnectionsCountByUserId.ts # Get connections count for specific user
└── connections/                        # Connection-centric operations
    ├── acceptConnection.ts             # Accept specific connection
    ├── declineConnection.ts            # Decline specific connection
    ├── removeConnection.ts             # Remove specific connection
    ├── fetchConnections.ts             # List established connections
    ├── fetchConnectionsCount.ts        # Get connections count
    ├── fetchSentPendingConnections.ts  # List sent pending requests
    └── fetchReceivedPendingConnections.ts # List received pending requests
```

### API Reorganization

The connection API follows a **resource-centric pattern** for maximum clarity and flexibility:

**User-centric operations** (user as main resource) under `/users` router:
- Follows: `POST /users/:userId/follow`, `GET /users/:userId/follow`, `DELETE /users/:userId/follow`
- Connections: `POST /users/:userId/connection`, `GET /users/:userId/connection`, `DELETE /users/:userId/connection`

**Connection-centric operations** (connection as main resource) under `/connections` router:
- `GET /connections` - List my connections
- `GET /connections/count` - Get my connections count
- `GET /connections/pending/sent` - List pending requests I sent
- `GET /connections/pending/received` - List pending requests I received
- `PUT /connections/:connectionId/accept` - Accept specific connection
- `PUT /connections/:connectionId/decline` - Decline specific connection
- `DELETE /connections/:connectionId` - Remove specific connection

This provides developers **choice**: use user-centric when thinking about users, connection-centric when managing connection entities directly. Accept/decline operations are only available via connectionId since they operate on specific connection records.

## Business Logic & Workflows

### 1. Connection Request Flow

```
User A → Request Connection → User B
                ↓
          pending status
                ↓
      User B: Accept | Decline
                ↓
         Status Update + Notifications
```

#### Request Validation Rules
- Cannot request connection to self
- Cannot have multiple active requests between same users
- Cannot request if previously blocked
- Cannot request if already connected
- Must be valid users in same project

#### Request Process
1. Validate request (see rules above)
2. Create Connection record with pending status
3. Set createdAt timestamp (automatic)
4. Trigger notification to receiver using `createNotification` helper

### 2. Response Workflows

#### Accept Connection
1. Validate: Only receiver can accept pending requests
2. Update status to accepted
3. Set respondedAt timestamp
4. Create bidirectional relationship
5. Trigger notification to requester only using `createNotification` helper

#### Decline Connection
1. Validate: Only receiver can decline pending requests
2. Update status to "declined"
3. Set respondedAt timestamp
4. Prevent requester from re-requesting (business rule)
5. Allow receiver to delete record and create new request later
6. No notification sent


### 3. Connection Management

#### Withdraw Request
- **Who**: Original requester
- **When**: pending status only
- **Action**: Delete connection record
- **Result**: Allows fresh request later

#### Disconnect
- **Who**: Either connected user
- **When**: accepted status only
- **Action**: Delete connection record
- **Result**: Allows fresh request later

### 4. Query Patterns

#### Get User's Connections
```typescript
// Bidirectional query - user is connected if they are requester OR receiver with accepted status
const connections = await Connection.findAll({
  where: {
    projectId,
    status: 'accepted',
    [Op.or]: [
      { requesterId: userId },
      { receiverId: userId }
    ]
  },
  include: [
    { model: User, as: 'requester' },
    { model: User, as: 'receiver' }
  ]
});
```

#### Get Pending Requests
```typescript
// Received requests
const receivedRequests = await Connection.findAll({
  where: { projectId, receiverId: userId, status: 'pending' },
  order: [['createdAt', 'DESC']]
});

// Sent requests
const sentRequests = await Connection.findAll({
  where: { projectId, requesterId: userId, status: 'pending' },
  order: [['createdAt', 'DESC']]
});
```

## Business Rules & Edge Cases

### 1. Duplicate Prevention
- **Rule**: Only one active Connection record between any two users
- **Implementation**: Unique constraint on (projectId, requesterId, receiverId)
- **Edge Case**: Handle race conditions in request creation

### 2. Re-request Logic
- **After declined**: Only the original receiver can delete the declined record and create a fresh request (role reversal)
- **After WITHDRAW**: Either user can initiate new request (record was deleted)
- **After DISCONNECT**: Either user can initiate new request (record was deleted)
- **Pattern**: Delete previous record and create new one for cleaner data and proper timestamps

### 3. Status Transitions

```
pending → accepted (by receiver)
pending → declined (by receiver)
pending → [DELETED] (by requester - withdraw)
accepted → [DELETED] (by either - disconnect)
declined → [DELETED] (by receiver only - to allow re-request)
```

Invalid transitions:
- declined → accepted (must delete and create new request)
- Cannot change status once responded (except delete for disconnect/re-request)

### 4. Notification Strategy

| Event | Notify Who | Type |
|-------|------------|------|
| Request Sent | Receiver | In-app only |
| Request Accepted | Requester | In-app only |
| Request Declined | No one | None |
| Connection Removed | No one | None |

## Integration Points


### 2. Notification System
Use existing `createNotification` helper and add new interfaces to `IAppNotification.ts`:

#### New Notification Interfaces to Add:
```typescript
// Add to src/interfaces/IAppNotification.ts
export interface ConnectionRequestNotification extends BaseNotificationParams {
  type: "connection-request";
  action: "open-profile";
  metadata: {
    connectionId: string;
    initiatorId: string;
    initiatorName: string | null | undefined;
    initiatorUsername: string | null | undefined;
    initiatorAvatar: string | null | undefined;
  };
}

export interface ConnectionAcceptedNotification extends BaseNotificationParams {
  type: "connection-accepted";
  action: "open-profile";
  metadata: {
    connectionId: string;
    initiatorId: string; // User who accepted (originally the receiver)
    initiatorName: string | null | undefined;
    initiatorUsername: string | null | undefined;
    initiatorAvatar: string | null | undefined;
  };
}

// Update NotificationParams union type to include:
// | ConnectionRequestNotification
// | ConnectionAcceptedNotification
```

#### Usage in Controllers:
```typescript
// Send connection request notification
import createNotification from "../../../helpers/createNotification";

await createNotification(req, {
  projectId,
  userId: receiverId,
  type: "connection-request",
  action: "open-profile",
  metadata: {
    connectionId: connection.id,
    initiatorId: requesterId,
    initiatorName: requester.name,
    initiatorUsername: requester.username,
    initiatorAvatar: requester.avatar,
  }
});

// Connection accepted notification
await createNotification(req, {
  projectId,
  userId: originalRequesterId,
  type: "connection-accepted",
  action: "open-profile",
  metadata: {
    connectionId: connection.id,
    initiatorId: receiverId,
    initiatorName: receiver.name,
    initiatorUsername: receiver.username,
    initiatorAvatar: receiver.avatar,
  }
});
```

### 3. User Associations
Extend User model with connection helpers:

```typescript
// In User model
async getConnections() {
  // Return all accepted connections for this user
}

async getPendingConnectionRequests() {
  // Return pending requests received by this user
}

async getSentConnectionRequests() {
  // Return pending requests sent by this user
}

async isConnectedTo(otherUserId: string) {
  // Check if connected to specific user
}
```

## Privacy & Security Considerations

### 1. Privacy Controls
- Users should be able to configure who can send them connection requests
- Option to require mutual follows before connection requests
- Ability to block users from sending any requests

### 2. Rate Limiting
- Limit connection requests per user per time period
- Prevent connection request spam

### 3. Data Privacy
- Connection lists may be sensitive - consider privacy settings
- Optional message field should be sanitized
- Consider GDPR implications for connection data

## Performance Considerations

### 1. Database Optimization
- Proper indexing for common query patterns
- Consider denormalization for connection counts
- Efficient bidirectional relationship queries

### 2. Caching Strategy
- Cache user connection lists
- Cache connection counts
- Invalidate cache on status changes

### 3. Scalability
- Consider sharding strategies for large datasets
- Batch operations for bulk connection management

## Migration Strategy

### 1. Database Migration

#### If Connection table doesn't exist (first deployment):
```sql
-- Sequelize will automatically create the table with correct schema
-- No migration needed - just deploy
```

#### If Connection table already exists:
```sql
-- Remove columns if they were previously deployed
ALTER TABLE Connections DROP COLUMN IF EXISTS requestedAt;
ALTER TABLE Connections DROP COLUMN IF EXISTS updatedAt;

-- Ensure correct schema matches implementation:
-- id (UUID, PRIMARY KEY)
-- projectId (UUID, NOT NULL)
-- requesterId (UUID, NOT NULL)
-- receiverId (UUID, NOT NULL)
-- status (ENUM: pending, accepted, declined)
-- message (TEXT, NULLABLE)
-- respondedAt (TIMESTAMP, NULLABLE)
-- createdAt (TIMESTAMP, NOT NULL)
```

#### Required Indexes:
```sql
-- Unique constraint to prevent duplicate requests
CREATE UNIQUE INDEX idx_connection_unique ON Connections (projectId, requesterId, receiverId);

-- Performance indexes
CREATE INDEX idx_connection_requester ON Connections (projectId, requesterId, status);
CREATE INDEX idx_connection_receiver ON Connections (projectId, receiverId, status);
CREATE INDEX idx_connection_status ON Connections (projectId, status);
CREATE INDEX idx_connection_created ON Connections (projectId, createdAt);
```

### 2. Model Registration
Ensure the Connection model is properly registered:
```typescript
// In your model initialization
Connection.initModel(sequelize);
Connection.associate();

// Export from models/index.ts
export { Connection };
```

### 3. Router Registration
Add to your main API router:
```typescript
// In your main router file
import { connectionsRouter } from './v5/routers';
app.use('/v5/connections', connectionsRouter);
```

### 4. API Versioning
- Add new endpoints under existing `/v5/` structure
- Maintain backward compatibility
- Document new endpoints in API documentation

### 5. Feature Rollout
- Implement behind feature flag
- Gradual rollout to projects
- Monitor performance impact

## Client Implementation Notes

### Notification Integration
The system generates notifications for:
- **Connection requests**: Receiver gets `connection-request` notification
- **Connection accepted**: Requester gets `connection-accepted` notification

Notification types to handle in your client:
```typescript
type ConnectionNotifications =
  | "connection-request"
  | "connection-accepted";

// Notification payloads you'll receive
interface ConnectionRequestNotification {
  type: "connection-request";
  action: "open-profile";
  metadata: {
    connectionId: string;
    initiatorId: string;
    initiatorName: string | null;
    initiatorUsername: string | null;
    initiatorAvatar: string | null;
  };
}

interface ConnectionAcceptedNotification {
  type: "connection-accepted";
  action: "open-profile";
  metadata: {
    connectionId: string;
    initiatorId: string; // User who accepted
    initiatorName: string | null;
    initiatorUsername: string | null;
    initiatorAvatar: string | null;
  };
}
```

### State Management Recommendations
```typescript
// Suggested client state structure
interface ConnectionState {
  connections: Connection[];
  pendingReceived: Connection[];  // Connections with status: "pending"
  pendingSent: Connection[];      // Connections with status: "pending"
  loading: boolean;
  pagination: PaginationInfo;
}

// The actual Connection interface matches the API responses
interface Connection {
  id: string;
  connectedUser?: User;    // For established connections
  user?: User;             // For pending requests
  type?: "received" | "sent";  // For pending requests
  message?: string;
  createdAt?: string;      // For pending requests (when request was made)
  requestedAt?: string;    // For established connections (when request was originally made)
  connectedAt?: string;    // For established connections (when connection was accepted)
}
```

### UI/UX Considerations
- Show badge count for pending received requests
- Distinguish between "sent" and "received" requests in UI
- Provide clear feedback for connection actions
- Handle optimistic updates for better UX
- Show connection status in user profiles
- Use connection status endpoint to show appropriate buttons:
  - "Send Connection Request" (status: "none")
  - "Request Sent" with withdraw option (status: "pending", type: "sent")
  - "Accept/Decline" buttons (status: "pending", type: "received")
  - "Connected" with disconnect option (status: "connected")
  - Handle declined state appropriately (status: "declined")

### Error Handling
Handle specific error codes for better user experience:
- `connection/request-declined`: Show message about who can re-initiate
- `connection/already-connected`: Update UI to show connected state
- `connection/request-pending`: Show existing request status

## Future Enhancements

### 1. User Blocking System
- Separate `Block` model for user-level blocking (not connection-specific)
- Apply to both connections and follows
- Prevent blocked users from sending any requests
- Allow users to block others even after connections are established

### 2. Connection Categories
- Different types of connections (friend, colleague, family)
- Category-specific privacy settings
- Filtered connection lists

### 3. Connection Recommendations
- Suggest connections based on mutual connections
- Import contacts for connection suggestions
- AI-powered connection recommendations

### 4. Advanced Features
- Connection request templates/categories
- Bulk connection management
- Connection analytics and insights

## Available React Hooks

The connection system exposes the following hooks for client use:

### Core Operations
- `useRequestConnection` - Send connection requests
- `useAcceptConnection` - Accept incoming requests
- `useDeclineConnection` - Decline incoming requests
- `useRemoveConnection` - Remove connections by ID
- `useRemoveConnectionByUserId` - Smart remove by user ID

### Data Fetching
- `useFetchConnections` - Get your connections
- `useFetchConnectionsCount` - Get your connection count
- `useFetchConnectionsByUserId` - Get any user's connections
- `useFetchConnectionsCountByUserId` - Get any user's connection count
- `useFetchSentPendingConnections` - Get your sent requests
- `useFetchReceivedPendingConnections` - Get your received requests

### Utilities
- `useGetConnectionStatus` - Check connection status with any user
- `useConnectionManager` - Unified hook for all connection operations

All hooks are fully typed and follow the existing Replyke patterns for consistency.
